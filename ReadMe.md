Semantic Versioning
===================
_Applies to Releases Only_

Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is a widely used standard for software versioning. It provides a simple and consistent method for versioning software projects and helps communicate version changes to stakeholders.

SemVer consists of three parts:

**Major version number:** This number changes when there are breaking changes to the software. Breaking changes are any changes that would require existing software to be modified or upgraded to work with the new version.

**Minor version number:** This number changes when new features are added to the software. The features are non-breaking and should not impact existing functionality.

**Patch version number:** This number changes when bug fixes are made to the software. These changes should not affect the functionality of the software.

SemVer uses the format of **Major.Minor. Patch.** For example, **2.0.0 or 1.1.3.**
